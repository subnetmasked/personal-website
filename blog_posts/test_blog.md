# The Problem with VPNs

## Are VPNs Really Anonymous?

The common belief that VPNs provide absolute privacy is flawed. Instead of trusting your ISP with your data, you're simply shifting that trust to the VPN provider. Many of these providers require personal information like your name, address, and even credit card details to sign up. This defeats the purpose of anonymity. Mullvad stands out as the only VPN that offers true privacy since it allows payments in cash and doesn't demand any personal data for account creation. Without these features, VPNs are not as private as they seem.
